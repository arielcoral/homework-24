// It isn't just one of your holiday games;
// You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter
// When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
// First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,
// Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,
// Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
// All of them sensible everyday names.
// There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
// Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
// Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
// But all of them sensible everyday names.
// But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,
// A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,
// Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
// Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?`;
